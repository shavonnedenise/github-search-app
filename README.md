# Hi! Welcome to the GitHub Repository Search App!

Fun fact, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
As of right now, there aren't any tests but once added, you can use this script to run them.

## Current Backlog for this Application

As a hopeful individual, there are a few functionalities I would love to add to this application, here is what I'm thinking so far!

### Back button using useHistory() from react-router

### Checking for empty strings and not displaying them in the filter dropdown

### Redesign SearchPage
