# Hi! Welcome to the GitHub Repository Search App! 👋🏾

With this application, you can search the GitHub repository API and it will be placed in a table for viewing.
Once populated with data, you can click on the Column Header to sort the data. You can also select an item from dropdown to filter the data as well!
Within the table, you can click on the Repository ID and you will be directed to the Details page to view additional information regarding the Repository.
Once you go back to the Search Page, you can enter a search value!

Rumor has it, the 404 Error page is pretty sweet 😉

## Current Backlog for this Application ✍🏾

As an eager individual, there are a few functionalities I would love to add to this application, here is what I'm thinking so far!

### ⭐️ Back button using useHistory() from react-router

### ⭐️ Checking for empty strings and not displaying them in the filter dropdown

### ⭐️ Redesign SearchPage
